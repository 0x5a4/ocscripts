# witherbegone

## Requirements
- A Robot
- A redstone card within that robot
- An inventory_controller within that robot
- A database upgrade with a wither skull in the first and a soul sand in the second slot
- Block placers setup in front of the robot in the shape of the wither
- A chest below the robot where skulls and soul sand will be inserted

### Note
Yes, the robot could place the blocks itself, but in my tests this has lead to the robot
being blown up by the wither.
